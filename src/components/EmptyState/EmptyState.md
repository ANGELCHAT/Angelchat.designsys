Empty states are used when a list, table, card, or section has no content to show.
This is an opportunity to provide explanation or guidance to help users progress. They are vital in making the experience feel more approachable and understandable.

```js
<EmptyState
  title="There are customers waiting on your website!"
  description="Install LiveChat on your website to see whoâ€™s online, what they do and chat with live."
  img={"./desert.svg"}
>
  <Button primary>Install LiveChat</Button>
  <p>
    Or <a>send instructions to your developers.</a>
  </p>
</EmptyState>
```
