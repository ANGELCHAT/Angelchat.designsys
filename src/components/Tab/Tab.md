Tabs make it easy to navigate between views within the same context. They should group similar content with different filters applied.

Give tab a clear label that describes its content.
Tab label should be set in sentence case, and should not exceed three words. Donâ€™t use icons in the tab labels.

```js
<Tabs>
  <TabsList>
    <Tab isSelected lightText="1">
      Agents
    </Tab>
    <Tab lightText="3">
      Groups
    </Tab>
  </TabsList>
</Tabs>               
```
